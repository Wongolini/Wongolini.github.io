excerpt: 'We show that: (1) YbdO (tentatively re-named CitR) regulation has an effect on bacterial growth at low pH with citrate supplementation. CitR is a repressor of the ybdNM operon and is implicated in the regulation of citrate lyase genes (citCDEFG); (2) YgfI (tentatively re-named DhfA) activates the dhaKLM operon that encodes the phosphotransferase system, DhfA is involved in formate, glycerol and dihydroxyacetone utilization; (3) YiaU (tentatively re-named LpsR) regulates the yiaT gene encoding an outer membrane protein, and waaPSBOJYZU operon is also important in determining cell density at the stationary phase and resistance to oxacillin microaerobically; (4) YneJ, re-named here as PtrR, directly regulates the expression of the succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Sad (also known as YneI), and is a predicted regulator of fnrS (a small RNA molecule). PtrR is important for bacterial growth in the presence of l-glutamate and putrescine as nitrogen/energy sources; and (5) YbhD and YcaN regulate adjacent y-genes on the genome.'
