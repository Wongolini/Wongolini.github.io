üìñ I am a PhD Candidate at Carnegie Science & Johns Hopkins University in the Cell Molecular Developmental Biology and Biophysics program with the Ludington Lab. 

üî¨ I am passionate about understanding microbial communities from an interdisciplinary systems approach with an emphasis on marine ecosystems.

üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ My thesis project focuses on microbial ecology, metabolism, and genetics of harmful algal bloom caused by cyanobacteria.

I love the sea. Having lived by an ocean all my life, I care deeply for coastal environemnts and the abundance of life that call it home. I think a lot about the delicate balance humanity often oversteps with the ocean and the importance of ensuring future generations can enjoy the beauty of the sea and all she has to offer. Microbes form the scaffold of marine ecosystems, and ensuring the stability of marine microecosystems is a critical part of conservation.

As a graduate student and researcher, I aim to apply my skills to improve our understanding of oceanographic microbial ecosystems and to communicate this knoweldge to better protect our coastal ecosystems. Harmful algal blooms, while natural, are exacerbated by anthropgenic climate warming and eutrophication. My project aims to identify how these organisms can quickly shift their metabolism from dormancy to supporting fast growing populations.

Currently, I am studying cyanobacteria _Syneccochus elongatus_ as a model organism for algal blooms. I aim to identify the essential gene set facillitates blooms and its transcriptional regulation to better understand the timing of blooms in response to environmental simulus. To emulate environemntal conditions and anthropgenic influences, I am constructing 

- Custom bioreactors (a photosynthetic turbidostat)
- The first high-throughput cyanobacterial growth apparatus for 96-well formats.

Current prediction models do not incorporate the fundemental biology of these photosynthetic microbes. My project aims to link the evolved biological response of cyanobacteria to their environment to improve prediction models. To understand how microbial communities react to climate change and pollution, we must first understand the natural physical context in which these organisms evolved to accomodate.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
