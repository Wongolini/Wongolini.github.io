Techniques in microbial physiology, microbial genomics, microbial evolution, and microbial ecology will be used to explore the role of microbes in industry, health, and the environment. Inquiry-based experiments will cover the fundamentals of both working with live microscopic organisms at the bench and bioinformatically analyzing their genomes at the computer. Attendance at the first lecture/lab is required. Nonattendance may result in the student being dropped from the course roster. Material lab fees will apply. Prerequisites: BILD 1.

Course material:
- Fundemental microbiology and bacteria physiology.
- Microbiology lab techniques
- Next generation sequencing technologies
- The microbiome and the Built Environment
- Bioinformatics



Led lab lectures, discussions and guided laboratory techniques. Graded lab reports and exams.
